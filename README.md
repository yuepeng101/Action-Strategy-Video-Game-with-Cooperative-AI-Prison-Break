Prison Break is an action-strategy game where players control a group of prisoners who are trying to escape from a maximum-security facility. Not only players will control their main character, but they will also have the ability to control three other prisoner characters simultaneously, each possessing different skills and roles while trying to escape the Prison. The levels are guarded by multiple types of prison guards who also possess unique abilities to stop the escaping prisoners. They can also adapt their strategy based on which style the player decides to approach: action-paced or stealth. 
The main objective is for the gang of prisoners to destroy the main gate in order to escape. Players may have to choose wisely which skills to use in order to defeat or sneak past the patrolling guards and reach the main gate. The core gameplay mechanic from Prison Break is allowing players to control multiple characters simultaneously and also deciding how they will play the game, while also having to face enemies that can adapt to different scenarios and providing a different experience each time the game is played.
